# DDPM_DFM
User defined functions for drag force calculation between fluid and particles in CFD-DEM coupling using ANSYS FLUENT and EDEM.
The drag force model "BL" uses the drag force coefficient proposed by Brown and Lawler (2003) and the drag force uses teh origincal form described in Di Felice (1994).
All the models have already been complied for serial and parallel computation.
