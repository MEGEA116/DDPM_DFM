1) Set the required environment variables as in 
  edem_cfd_adaptor_build/README.Linux:

  If your local EDEM distribution is not at
   /opt/DEMSolutions/EDEM_2.7

  in the file "tools/set_edem_env_vars.csh" edit the line:
    setenv EDEM_INSTALL_DIR /opt/DEMSolutions/EDEM_2.7

  or in the file "tools/set_edem_env_vars.sh" edit the line:
    export EDEM_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/DEMSolutions/EDEM_2.7

  to match you local distributions location.

  cd to the directory containing the tools and edem_cfd_adaptor_build directories

  Set the required environment variables using either
    source ./tools/set_edem_env_vars.csh
  or
    source ./tools/set_edem_env_vars.sh


2) Ensure that FLUENT_INC environment variable is set to your local Fluent installation directory


3) Install the scons utility from:
scons.org/pages/download.html


4) Compile the UDF

Make sure the directory:
edem_coupling_build/tools
is in your PYTHONPATH environment variable as scons uses python files stored here.

cd lib_edem_coupling

and run:

For EDEM 2.6
scons dimensions=3d  USER_OBJECT_PATH=$EDEM_ADAPTOR_OBJECT_DIR   USER_LIBRARIES=$EDEM_LIBRARY_PATH/libEDEMCouplingClientV2_2_0.so

For EDEM 2.7
scons dimensions=3d  USER_OBJECT_PATH=$EDEM_ADAPTOR_OBJECT_DIR   USER_LIBRARIES=$EDEM_LIBRARY_PATH/libEDEMCouplingClientV2_3_0.so
